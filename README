This test directory demonstrates what we believe to be a bug in the library implementation
of the OAA functionality in Vowpal wabbit.

(Assuming a shell cd'ed to this directory)

To create the model to use for predictions and to test it on 'vwtest.txt':
./train_test.sh

To compile the C++ code called by the java program
./createso.sh

To compile and run the java code that demonstrates the problem
./execjava.sh

Correct output would be the same as batch.out, i.e. the label 15 five times. Only the first label is correct.
Note that vwtest.txt is just the same example repeated five times. The label for the example encodes the expected
vw label within it for easy viewing of the results.
